17/3:
pre_assembler.c- 
    oren- make sure pre_assembler works
    yuval- complete todo

shared/types-
    yuval- table for macros (get macro by its name)
    oren- table for labels (get label address by name)

assembler_forst_pass- 
    yuval- master method + make todos
    oren- subfuncs

assembler_second_pass- 
    oren- master method (probably only method(?))


Things to keep in mind:

    an initial TODO list. later, tasks will be splittel into corrosponding files. 

    registers: 24 bits each, r0 to r7

    PSW (program status word): keeps track of flags

    a command is 1 to 3 words

    words are encided as hex values

    commands: mov, cmp, add, sub, lea, clr, not, inc, dec, jmp, bne, jsr, red, prn, rts, stop

    sentences are separated by newlines and tabs (\n, \t)

    sentence types are:

        empty
        comment- starts with ;
        instruction
        command

        more info in PDF

    table of all operands and theoir respective binary codes - values set at runtime

    separate data from instructions

    all errors are to be encountered. an error wont stop the program
    

    fields:
    
        label- 
            starts the symbol and ends with :
            can only be declared once
            case sensitive
            cannot be a keyword

        number-
            starts with optional + or -
            base-10
            only Z


        string-
            ascii series
            printable
            surroded by "
            space is also a part of the string


Run order:

    receive file of source to run
    
    pre-assembler- read input, then convert macros to actual instructions
    if failed raise error; then halt
    else save output
    algorythm in p.n. 40 (16)

    declare symbols, then declared symbols are given values dynamically

    go over raw source twice: forst find labels and replace them with values (real locations), second to write actual machine code

    

    convery symbols to machine code

    make a file of ready-to-run example



Things to do:

    1. implement described above commands:
        2 operands
        1 operand
        0 operands

    2. implement macros (dynamic allocation)
        no מקוננות macros
        macro name cant be an instruction name
        no need to check macroend phrase

    3. Files to implement so far
        * pre_assembler - according to the algorithm in page 40 (46 according to pdf)
        * first_pass - page 40 (46 pdf), algorithm in page 44 (50 pdf)
        * second_pass -  algorithm in page 45 (51 pdf)
        * input files to test the program - at the end
            * relevant file types - object, entries, exteranls
